# cpl_generative
Processing sketch in process for a procedurally generated logo for an identity systems class at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Uses code from [this processing forum snippet](https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/filling-a-shape-with-other-shapes.html) to generate the circles.

### Current goals
Also really my notes for myself.

 - should generate once and save to a file (preferably an SVG) and not regenerate every time the mouse moves
 - ability to set certain number of circles per side
 - circles should not overlap with other circles
   - (maybe [this git](https://github.com/martymcguire/ThingiverseCollage/blob/master/ThingiverseCollage.pde) can help figure that out?)
 - possibly ability to set one circle to be larger than the others (idk how to even do this)
   - basic initial GUI to accomplish this upon applet load
